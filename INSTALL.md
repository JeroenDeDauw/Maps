# Maps installation

These are the installation and configuration instructions for the [Maps extension](README.md).

For an overview of the different versions of the extension and their compatibility, scroll down.

## Download and installation

Go to the root directory of your MediaWiki installation.

If you have previously installed Composer skip to step 2.

To install Composer, just download http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar into your
current directory.

    wget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar

#### Step 2

Now using Composer, install Maps

    php composer.phar require mediawiki/maps "*"

#### Verify installation success

As final step, you can verify Maps got installed by looking at the Special:Version page on your wiki
and verifying the Maps extension is listed.

If you want to use the Semantic MediaWiki integration, you will also need to install Semantic MediaWiki.

## Configuration

At present, minimal configuration is needed to get Maps running. Configuration is done like in most
MediaWiki extensions, by placing some simple snippets of PHP code at the bottom of MediaWiki's
LocalSettings.php.

As of June 2016, Google requires you to provide an API key when you where not already using their
maps API. This means that you will either need to configure this key, or use another of the
supported mapping services.

### Required configuration for Google Maps

$GLOBALS['egMapsGMaps3ApiKey'] = 'your-api-key';

### Not using Google Maps by default

For OpenLayers:

$GLOBALS['egMapsDefaultService'] = 'openlayers';

For Leaflet:

$GLOBALS['egMapsDefaultService'] = 'leaflet';

You might also want to fully disable Google Maps by placing a copy of the `egMapsAvailableServices`
setting in LocalSettings, and removing the `googlemaps3` line.

See the [Maps settings file](Maps_Settings.php) for all available configuration options.

### Platform compatibility and release status

The PHP and MediaWiki version ranges listed are those in which Maps is known to work. It might also
work with more recent versions of PHP and MediaWiki, though this is not guaranteed. Increases of
minimum requirements are indicated in bold.
